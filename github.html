THE BEST PERSON OF ALL IS THE ONE WHO CAN VERILY ANALYSE HIM IN A BETTER WAY. SO TAKE YOUR OWN TIME TO ANALYSE YOURSELF INSTEAD OTHERS. <br /></span><br /><i>                                 O HEART," WHAT AM I GOOD FOR? WHAT IS MY STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS? WHERE DO I FIND HAPPINESS? WHERE AND WHAT I FAIL FOR? WHERE AM I LEARNING MY MISTAKES?"......ETC.<br /></i> <br /><span style="font-family: Aclonica;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; YOU CAN'T READ OR SKIM THE WHOLE WORLD. BUT U CAN READ YOURSELF IN ORDER TO LOVE YOURSELF MORE AND IT WILL RENDER YOU TO WRITE YOUR OWN TEST WELL. NO ONE CAN ANALYSE YOU BETTER THAN YOURSELF. BECAUSE THEY NEVER SPEND THE REQUIRED TIME TO DO THAT SO. BUT U CAN SPEND UR OWN TIME IN ORDER TO GET READY YOURSELF. <br /></span><br />SPEND SOME TIME FOR YOU..!!<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: Algerian; font-size: medium;"><div style="text-align: center;">IS PERCEPTION MATTERS?</div></span></div><div><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Many of us would be thinking that we need to be 100% in all. isn't it? Many of us would be in fond of getting the best in this world. Isn't it? Then, just spend few minutes to think what is bad in this world. The genuine answer is "NO". Because, you would be thinking that something is the best which may be hate by others. AM I RIGHT?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: georgia;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We of course the human, having same no of eyes but with different vision. So when two people do analysis on the same thing and if they were asked to conclude them, the both conclusion could never be same all the time.<br /> Lemme take an example, if I and my friend are asked to select a mobile brand to buy, I will need some special features which may or may not be same by her. I may ignore the quality of camera and will stick on to the memory storage and some other features since my usage of mobile could be differ. At the same time she might consider the camera quality and may ignore the storage and battery conditions. Obviously we both will select different mobile brands. For me, my selection would be better than her's. For her, her choice would be better.</span><br /> <span style="font-family: georgia;"><br />Conclusion: It doesn't mean that the mobile brand that was chosen by her is not good since I didn't choose.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Everything depends on our own perspective. The is no common best thing for all and at the same time, there is no bad thing for all. Everything differs. so, its better to analyse yourself in order to find what is good and the best for you than thinking deeply with other's words. I didn't mean that we should not consider other's words but, we should not stick on to them alone.<br />Think wisely and proceed further.  </span></div><div><br /></div><div>FOR YOU TO BE MORE MOTIVATED:</div><div>1.&nbsp;<a href=" EVENTUALLY I FAIL TO KNOWN THAT FAILURE MAKES US TO BE SO STRONG THAN SUCCESS AND IT WILL SCULPTURE US WITH MORE LEARNING.  THEN MY HEART SAYS,&quot; YOU FAILED AND LEARNT SOMETHING WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT REPEAT&quot;.  THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE OF OUR TRY&quot;.  IT IS OK TO FAIL THAN TO BE A PERSON WHO CAN'T EVEN TRY ONCE JUST BECAUSE OF A FEAR WHETHER WE WOULD FAIL.

IF WE WERE PERFECT IN ALL, THEN SOME OF THE CONCEPTS LIKE PATIENCE, APOLOGIES, LEARNING ARE NOT NEEDED IN OUR CHALLENGING LIFE.  AT THE SAME TIME PERFECTION DEPENDS ON OTHERS TOO  OF YOU DO ANY WORK AND IF YOUR ARE EXPECTING IT TO BE PERFECT, IT INDIRECTLY SAYS THAT THE WORK NEEDS EVERYONE'S SATISFACTION.  IT IS OBVIOUSLY THOUGH TO HAVE EVERYONE'S SATISFACTION.  IT IS OKAY TO EXPECT OTHER'S APPRECIATION. BUT IT IS NOT OKAY TO RELY ON ONLY OTHERS'S SATISFACTION. BE YOURSELF. TRUE TO YOURSELF FIRST. THEN, AUTOMATICALLY EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY.    O MY HEART,&quot; TRY TO SATISFY YOUR MIND AND SOUL RATHER THAN OTHERS.
